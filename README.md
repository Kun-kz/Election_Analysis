# Election Analysis

## Project Overview

### Original Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given us the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1.	Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2.	Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3.	Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4.	Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5.	Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

### Challenge Overview
The original project shows the audit results based on candidate information. This challenge aims at adding the following information to the election analysis. By doing this, our project will have complete election results of each candidate and county. 

1.	Get a complete list of counties in this election.
2.	Calculate the voter turnout for each county.
3.	Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
4.	Determine the county with the largest turnout.

## Summary
This script provides us the Colorado election audit results. It counts vote efficiently and makes the result easy to read. With some modifications, we believe that it can be widely used for any election.

Our current script presents the results based on County and Candidate separately. One modification is that we can separate the votes based on candidates within each county. In this way, we can have detailed information about candidateâ€™s votes within each county.

The current election results show County vote turnout and Candidate votes without an order. By adding sorted function in our script, we can show the vote information in a descending order. For example, by adding the following code to our script, our results show as follows:

In this way, we can easily find out the county with the largest vote turnout and the winning candidate.

To summarize, our script gives us the election audit results quickly and efficiently. With a few modifications, we believe that this script can be widely used in any election.
